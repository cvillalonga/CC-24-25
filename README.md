## :pencil2: Problem Description

The primary objective of this project is to develop a fitness tracker that enables users to monitor their physical activity and track their food consumption. The application will help users achieve their health and fitness goals by providing detailed insights into their daily caloric intake and macronutrient distribution (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates). 

Users will be able to:

- Log their daily food consumption, with options to input the name of the food item, calorie count, and macro breakdown.
- Track physical activities and calculate calories burned based on various exercises.
- Set personalized health and fitness goals, allowing the app to provide tailored recommendations and feedback.
